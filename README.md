This repository is associated with the manuscript [Competing basal-ganglia pathways determine the difference between stopping and deciding not to go](http://www.elifesciences.org/content/4/e08723) and contains code and documentation for fitting various inhibitory control and decision models to behavioral data.

Pull requests should be made on this branch for testing. Stable additions will be merged with the master branch periodically.

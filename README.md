#### Race Against Drift Diffusion (RADD) model

This repository is associated with the manuscript [Competing basal-ganglia pathways determine the difference between stopping and deciding not to go](http://www.elifesciences.org/content/4/e08723) and contains code and documentation for fitting various inhibitory control and decision models to behavioral data.

---
The following link contains a few demonstrations on fitting models with RADD and some basic simulation and visualization methods. This repository (+ docs & demos) will continue to be updated as the code is refactored (and properly commented). Updates in the near future will be focused on standardizing the code for more general application to single, binary, and multiple-alternative decision tasks.

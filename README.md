#### Race Against Drift Diffusion (RADD) model

This repository is associated with the manuscript [Competing basal-ganglia pathways determine the difference between stopping and deciding not to go](http://www.elifesciences.org/content/4/e08723) and contains code and documentation for fitting various inhibitory control and decision models to behavioral data.

The ***elife2015*** branch is a snapshot of the code at the time of publication and contains a brief tutorial on how to run fits & simulations etc. described in the study. Ongoing developments will be pushed to the ***dev*** branch until stable enough to merge with the ***master*** branch (currently in alpha). We're hoping to release a stable version for public use in the next month or so.

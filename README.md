#### Race Against Drift Diffusion (RADD) model

This repository is associated with the manuscript "Competing basal-ganglia pathways determine the difference between stopping and deciding not to go" and contains code and documentation for fitting various inhibitory control models to behavioral data.

This code should not be used for any type of clinical purposes.

The following link contains a few demonstrations of fitting models with RADD as well as some basic simulation and visualization methods. This repository (+ docs & demos) will be continue to be updated as the code is properly commented and refactored for more general application to user-specific datasets, novel task designs, etc.

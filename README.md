##### Description of branches
* The **elife2015** branch is a snapshot of the code at the time of publication and contains a brief tutorial on how to run fits & simulations etc. described in the study (see demo [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/CoAxLab/radd/blob/elife2015/demo/RADD_Demo_Updated.ipynb)). 

* Ongoing developments will be pushed to the **dev** branch and periodically merged with the **master** branch. We're hoping to release a stable version for public use within the next few weeks.

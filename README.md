#### Race Against Drift Diffusion (RADD) model

This repository is associated with the manuscript "Competing basal-ganglia pathways determine the difference between stopping and deciding not to go" and contains code and documentation for fitting various inhibitory control models to behavioral data.

This code should not be used for any type of clinical purposes.

Currently under development. The link below still contains useful examples of the model functionality but the code is outdated. A more comprehensive set of examples and tutorials for using the model will be posted within the next couple of weeks.

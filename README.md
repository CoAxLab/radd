#### Race Against Drift Diffusion (RADD) model

This repository is associated with the manuscript "Competing basal-ganglia pathways determine the difference between stopping and deciding not to go" and contains code and documentation for fitting various inhibitory control models to behavioral data.

This code should not be used for any type of clinical purposes.

The following link contains a few demonstrations on fitting models with RADD and some basic simulation and visualization methods. This repository (+ docs & demos) will continue to be updated as the code is refactored (and properly commented). Updates in the near future will be focused on standardizing the data format and various stages of the fitting routine to make it easier for users to apply the code to their own datasets, novel task designs, etc.
